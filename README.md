# Tutorial 07 - Timestamps

## tl;dr

- We add abstractions for timer hardware, and implement them for the ARM architectural timer in
  `_arch/aarch64`.
- The new timer functions are used to annotate UART prints with timestamps, and to get rid of the
  cycle-based delays in the `GPIO` device driver, which boosts accuracy.
- A `warn!()` macro is added.

## Test it

Check it out via chainboot (added in previous tutorial):
```console
$ make chainboot
